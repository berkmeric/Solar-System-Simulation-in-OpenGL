# Solar-System-Simulation-in-OpenGL
Project files are in master branch.

Conducted a Solar System Simulation with a “Scene graph” to manage and render hierarchical
structures of celestial bodies, applied “Texture mapping” techniques to surface textures to
planetary models, : Implemented “Phong shading” model for lighting computation.
Demonstrating an understanding of 3D graphics concepts and their application in real-time
simulations.
- Technologies: JavaScript, OpenGL
